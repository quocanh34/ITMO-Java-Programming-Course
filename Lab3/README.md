## Laboratory work #3. ##

### The program must meet the following requirements: ###

1. The modified model must comply with the SOLID principles.
1. The program must contain at least two interfaces and one abstract class (the nomenclature must be agreed with the teacher).
1. The developed classes must override the ```equals()```, ```toString()``` and ```hashCode()``` methods.
1. The program must contain at least one enumerated type (enum).

### Work order: ###

1. Refine the application object model.
1. Redraw the class diagram according to the changes made to the model.
1. Agree with the teacher about the changes made to the model.
1. Modify the program in accordance with the changes made to the model.

### Individual specification: ###

Text has been lost. It was part of “Neznayka on the Moon” fairy tale. The arrival of the expedition to the moon was described, a dialogue between a Neznayka with a local journalist about the differences between life on Earth and the Moon. Further, according to the plot, Neznayka handed over samples of terrestrial plants to lunar scientists who began to study them.

### The work report should contain: ###

1. The text of the task.
1. Class diagram of the implemented object model.
1. The source code of the program.
1. The result of the program.
1. Conclusions on the work.

### Questions to defend laboratory work: ###

1. The principles of object-oriented programming SOLID and STUPID.
1. ```Object``` class. The default implementation of its methods.
1. Features of the implementation of inheritance in Java. Simple and multiple inheritance.
1. Abstract class concept. The ```abstract``` modifier.
1. Interface concept. Implementation of interfaces in Java, default methods. Differences from abstract classes.
1. Enumerated data type (enum) in Java. Features of implementation and use.
1. Methods and fields with ```static``` and ```final``` modifiers.
1. Overloading and overriding methods. Return data type covariants.
1. Elements of functional programming in Java syntax. Functional interfaces, lambda expressions. Method references
