## Laboratory work #1. ##

Write a Java program that performs the appropriate action. The program must meet the following requirements:

1. It should be packed into an executable jar archive.
1. The expression must be evaluated in accordance with the rules for evaluating mathematical expressions (the order of actions must be followed, etc.).
1. The program must use math functions from the Java standard library.
1. The result of evaluating the expression must be output to the standard output stream in the specified format.

The execution of the program must be demonstrated on the  ```helios``` server.

### Individual specification: ###

1. Create a one-dimensional array d of type ```long```. Fill it in with even numbers from 2 to 20 inclusive in descending order.
1. Create a one-dimensional array x of type ```double```. Fill it with 16 random numbers ranging from -11.0 to 5.0.
1. Create a 10x16 two-dimensional array d. Calculate its elements using the following formula (where x = x [j]):

1. Print the resulting array in two decimal places.

### The laboratory report should contain: ###

1. The text of the task.
1. The source code of the program.
1. The result of the program.
1. Conclusions on the work.
